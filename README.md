Skills Demonstration for Chris S.

Weâ€™ve created a new smartphone app that enables users to snap a photo of a business card and have the information from the card automatically extracted and added to their contact list. We need you to write the component that parses the results of the optical character recognition (OCR) component in order to extract the name, phone number, and email address from the processed business card image.

Built with Apache Maven 3.5.2 and Java jdk1.8.0_161. 

To test and build an executable jar, run **mvn clean package**.  The jar will be created in **executionDir/target**.

To run the executable jar, go to the directory with the jar.  Then run:  java -jar chris-businesscard.jar
